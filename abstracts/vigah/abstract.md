# Abstract

The restoration and conservation of carbon-rich natural ecosystems such as peatlands have been in the spotlight in recent times. A major focus nowadays is to map the carbon stocks and other properties for both climate regulation and biodiversity support as is enshrined in for example the EU’s recent Nature Restoration Law. While historic management of peatlands have transformed most into carbon sources, traditional methods to routinely map their properties or account for their carbon stocks under historic or contemporary management practices are generally inefficient and labour-intensive. Geophysical sensing techniques combined with digital soil mapping can counteract these challenges given the rapidity of the former and the possibility to obtain spatial products of given soil properties as well as their uncertainties. In this study, we employed proximal gamma radiometric datasets, coordinates and terrain elevation to (1) identify zones with distinct soil types and (2) subsequently employed peat depth interpreted from GPR measurements together with terrain and gamma variables to predict the thickness of the soil in the distinct soil type zones using both linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms. Preliminary results indicate potential of the combined use of proximal sensing data and terrain variables to estimate the peat depth at sufficient accuracy levels. The results have implications for proper C accounting and effective planning of peatland restoration measures.
