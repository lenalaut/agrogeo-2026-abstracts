  title: Multi-sensor mapping of peat depth in a restored Dutch peatland area
  description: The restoration and conservation of carbon-rich natural ecosystems such as peatlands have been in the spotlight in recent times. In this study, we employed proximal gamma radiometric datasets, coordinates and terrain elevation to (1) identify zones with distinct soil types and (2) subsequently employed peat depth interpreted from GPR measurements together with terrain and gamma variables to predict the thickness of the soil in the distinct soil type zones using both linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms.
