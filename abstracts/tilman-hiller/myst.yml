  title: Investigating the effect of sugar beets and maize crops on EMI and GPR signals
  description: Agrogeophysical methods have demonstrated high potential to face upcoming challenges posed by climate change, such as water scarcity. Here, we combined Electromagnetic Induction and Ground Penetrating Radar  to investigate small-scale changes linked to different cropping systems over different periods of the growing season.
