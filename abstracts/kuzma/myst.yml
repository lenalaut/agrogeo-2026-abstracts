  title: 'Physics-informed neural networks for forward ERT modeling: an initial step toward mesh-free, time-dependent coupled hydro-geophysical inversion'
  description: Electrical resistivity tomography is a cornerstone method in agrogeophysics. Despite its widespread use, standard numerical inversion schemes face significant challenges, such as resolving the complex subsurface geometries and handling high-contrast boundaries that introduce mesh-related artifacts. This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network approach for solving the forward ERT problem as a foundational step toward overcoming these limitations.
