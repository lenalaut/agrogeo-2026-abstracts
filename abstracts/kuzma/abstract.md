# Abstract

Electrical resistivity tomography is a cornerstone method in agrogeophysics. Despite its widespread use, standard numerical inversion schemes face significant challenges, such as resolving the complex subsurface geometries and handling high-contrast boundaries that introduce mesh-related artifacts. Moreover, because resistivity is sensitive to both water content and salinity, a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion is often required. Numerical solvers, however, encounter a major computational bottleneck in such multi-physics problems: they must store and invert large global matrices, which becomes computationally prohibitive for high-resolution, time-dependent simulations.
This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach for solving the forward ERT problem as a foundational step toward overcoming these limitations. Unlike numerical solvers that rely on discrete meshes, the proposed PINN framework approximates the electrical potential as a continuous, differentiable function of spatial coordinates. We trained the network to solve Poisson’s equation across various 2D resistivity models and validated the results against the well-established numerical solver pyGIMLi.
The results demonstrate that the PINN approach achieves spatial accuracy comparable to numerical simulations. However, the essential advantage lies in the computational architecture. Unlike numerical methods that must hold the entire system matrix in memory, the PINN optimization utilizes mini-batching, allowing the problem to be processed in small subsets. This decouples memory usage from the problem size. These characteristics serve as a gateway to time-dependent hydrogeophysical inversion, making it computationally feasible to couple Poisson’s equation with hydrological models (e.g., Richards equation) within a unified framework to resolve the water-salinity ambiguity, especially in rapidly evolving subsurface environment.
