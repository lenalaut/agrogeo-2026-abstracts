# Abstract

In arid and semi-arid regions, terminal drought is a primary constraint on wheat production. This study utilized Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to non-invasively quantify root water uptake (RWU) and phenotype genotypes with contrasting root system architectures (RSA) under field conditions. Four genotypes: WM-203, WM-140, Galil, and IPLR-0760, were selected for in-depth monitoring based on diverse combinations of root biomass and angle. Time-lapse ERT surveys were converted into soil water content maps using depth calibrated pedophysical models to estimate RWU at high spatiotemporal resolution.

The results revealed distinct, genotype specific RWU strategies. High biomass genotypes (WM-203 and WM-140) exhibited the highest total uptake, correlating with superior grain yields. WM-203 prioritized shallow layers, while WM-140 accessed deeper soil late in the season. Conversely, low biomass genotypes showed reduced uptake and varying efficiencies. Notably, IPLR-0760 (wide-angle, low-biomass) extracted a moderate amount of water but produced the lowest yield, indicating significant physiological inefficiency. In contrast, Galil (narrow-angle, low-biomass) achieved a moderate yield despite having the lowest seasonal uptake, demonstrating high water productivity driven by early phenology.

These findings highlight that while root biomass influences uptake capacity, effective use of water and resource allocation are equally critical for drought adaptation. This study demonstrates ERT as a powerful tool for real-time phenotyping, offering actionable insights for breeding climate-resilient wheat varieties.
