  title: ERT-Based Phenotyping of Root Architecture and Water Use Efficiency in Wheat
  description: In arid and semi-arid regions, terminal drought is a primary constraint on wheat production. This study utilized Electrical Resistivity Tomography to non-invasively quantify root water uptake and phenotype genotypes with contrasting root system architectures under field conditions.
