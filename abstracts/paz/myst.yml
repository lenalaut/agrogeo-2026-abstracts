  title: Building up a plot-scale hydrogeological model using results from near-surface geophysical techniques
  description: Região Oeste, located in western Portugal, is an important agricultural area where groundwater faces the risk of quantitative depletion due to increasing aquifer exploitation and climate-driven decreases in precipitation, as well as qualitative degradation caused by the increasing influx of pollutants associated with land-use conversion toward hyper-intensive farming. In this study, we present preliminary findings of a hydrogeological model of the Santo António stream valley in Cadaval municipality.
