# Abstract

Soil salinization is a major constraint on agricultural productivity, requiring efficient monitoring tools to support sustainable management. This study evaluates the capability of electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensing combined with inversion technique to monitor soil salinity and sodicity across several irrigated agricultural lands in Portugal. The proposed workflow includes time-lapse EMI surveys to measure apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), inversion of ECa to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of bulk soil electrical conductivity (σ), calibration of σ against laboratory-derived indicators of salinity and sodicity (ECe, SAR, ESP), and generation of salinity and sodicity cross sections.
Results demonstrate that the performance of this methodology is strongly site-dependent. In the Lezíria de Vila Franca region, high salinity levels and low textural variability enabled accurate prediction of soil salinity and sodicity from EMI-derived σ. Conversely, in the Roxo irrigation district, substantial variations in soil texture and low salinity reduced the correlation between σ and salinity indicators, limiting predictive capability. Additional challenges arise when applying time-lapse EMI for monitoring salinity, due to dynamic factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and groundwater fluctuation that influence EMI responses and complicate the interpretation of salinity changes, particularly within the root zone.
Overall, EMI offers major advantages over traditional soil sampling, enabling rapid, non-invasive, and spatially extensive assessments. However, reliable retrieval of soil salinity from EMI data requires careful consideration of site-specific soil processes, inversion parameters, and comprehensive ECa datasets. Effective implementation also requires close collaboration among geophysicists, soil scientists, and hydrologists to develop conceptual models of salinity and water dynamics.
