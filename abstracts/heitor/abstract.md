# Abstract

Soil water retention capacity and soil structure are fundamental properties that influence agroecosystems, for instance plant growth, nutrient cycling, and hydromechanical dynamics. The soil water retention capacity (SWRC) determines the availability of moisture for sustaining crops, and collectively regulates infiltration, storage, and drainage. Similarly, soil structure controls aeration, root penetration, and microbial activity, thereby shaping the physical environment for plant development. Understanding these parameters and how they change in agroecosystem is critical for modelling water flow, predicting crop responses under variable climatic conditions, and designing sustainable management practices. This is because poor soil structure can lead to compaction, erosion, and reduced hydraulic conductivity and thus water movement, impairing productivity and crop yields. Integrating geophysical techniques for monitoring soil condition enables non-invasive characterization of these properties at field scale, supporting precision agriculture and soil conservation strategies.
In this paper, the interconnected role of soil water retention and structure in agrogeophysics is highlighted and their significance for optimizing resource use and mitigating environmental impacts in modern farming systems it outlined. The author’s experience in geotechnical engineering applications and interaction of soil and root systems is drawn upon to establish challenges when applying similar techniques in agricultural systems. The results show that seismic methods can accurately capture soil density but highlight some challenge if the soils are surveyed in dry conditions. In addition, the results also show that the shear wave velocity can detect changes in soil structure which are critical for agricultural systems.
