# Abstract

Historical botanical gardens are unique sites of conservation, research, education, and connection with the plant world. In historical city centers such as Lisbon and other European capitals, high building density has led to increased soil sealing due to urban development.
The Botanical Garden of Lisbon is located in the city center, on highly valuable land. A construction project involving a building with underground parking levels has been proposed for an adjacent area at a higher elevation. This project may alter groundwater flow toward the garden. Previous studies used numerical groundwater modelling to evaluate the potential impact of these underground structures on groundwater levels within the garden; however, the modelling scale was too coarse to reliably assess the real influence of the proposed construction on local groundwater resources. Furthermore, the main objective is to evaluate the role of groundwater in tree health, which cannot be adequately addressed using this approach because the depth of tree root systems remains unknown.
To overcome these limitations, a methodology integrating two non-invasive geophysical techniques—ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)—was applied. The objectives were to assess groundwater levels in the construction area and establish the piezometric surface, and to determine whether tree root zones reach the saturated zone, establish a groundwater baseline, and propose protective measures.
Results indicate that the piezometric surface and tree root zones extend to depths of up to 3.0 m, demonstrating that tree roots can reach groundwater levels. This highlights the need for groundwater monitoring and management strategies.
