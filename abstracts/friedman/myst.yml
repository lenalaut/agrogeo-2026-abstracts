  title: Polarization processes and energy relationships between cations and negatively charged soil particles as revealed by Wien effect measurements
  description: The electrical conductivity of an electrolytic solution is expected to be independent of the applied electrical field strength according to Ohm’s law. With the help of a home made, low-cost apparatus yielding a short high-voltage pulse, we have measured the increase in EC of mono and multivalent cationic suspensions made of clay fraction particles separated from natural soils.
