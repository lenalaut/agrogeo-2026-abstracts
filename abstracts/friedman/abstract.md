# Abstract

The electrical conductivity (EC) of an electrolytic solution is expected to be independent of the applied electrical field strength (E) according to Ohm’s law, and the deviation from this when  increases with increasing E is known as the Wien effect. With the help of a home made, low-cost apparatus yielding a short (about 10^-5s) high-voltage pulse that enables electrical fields of up to 2∙10^7 V/m, we have measured the increase in EC of mono and multivalent cationic suspensions made of clay fraction (<2 micron) particles separated from natural soils. The electrical conductivity increase of the clay suspensions with increasing E was up to four-fold. This general trend of EC increase can be explained by a greater polarization up to full dissociation of the counter ions from the particles, thus increasing the contribution of those ions to the overall EC of the suspension. In this sense the variation of EC with E reflects the “binding strength” of the counter ions to the charged particles. In this lecture we will demonstrate the application of the Wien effect method for different particle – counter ions systems, discuss possible positive and negative (i.e., EC decreasing with increasing E) Wien effect mechanisms, and propose a simplified thermodynamic interpretation of the Wien effect measurements in terms of mean free Gibbs' binding and adsorption energies.
