# Abstract

Subsoil processes are increasingly recognized as key components of agroecosystem functioning, particularly with respect to water availability, root development, and the long-term sustainability of soil management practices. Both biological and mechanical interventions have been proposed as means to modify subsoil properties, yet their effects are often difficult to observe under field conditions due to strong spatial heterogeneity and limited accessibility of deeper soil layers. In this study, a long-term field experiment was used to investigate subsoil behaviour under contrasting management strategies that combined different vegetation pre-conditioning approaches with mechanical and organic subsoil treatments. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) was employed as a non-invasive method to monitor apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) across multiple spatial scales and over several growing seasons. Repeated field-scale surveys were complemented by point-scale measurements to capture both spatial variability and short-term temporal dynamics. Initial EMI mapping was conducted to characterize the inherent spatial variability of the experimental site and to provide a reference framework for subsequent analyses. Repeated EMI measurements over time were then used to investigate the subsoil conditions under contrasting management histories. By integrating multi-temporal and multi-scale EMI observations, this work aims to improve the understanding of how contrasting subsoil management strategies influence subsurface dynamics and to demonstrate the value of geophysical monitoring for long-term agricultural field experiments.
