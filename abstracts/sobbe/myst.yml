  title: 'Non-invasive monitoring of subsoil structural changes: a four-year EMI study on bio-drilling and mechanical melioration'
  description: Subsoil processes are increasingly recognized as key components of agroecosystem functioning, particularly with respect to water availability, root development, and the long-term sustainability of soil management practices. In this study, a long-term field experiment was used to investigate subsoil behaviour under contrasting management strategies that combined different vegetation pre-conditioning approaches with mechanical and organic subsoil treatments.
