  title: Investigating the effect of maize roots and nitrate using horizontal crosshole GPR data – A case study from the field minirhizotron facilities
  description: The non-invasive imaging of small-scale soil and root-zone heterogeneities remains a critical yet challenging frontier in agrogeophysics. In recent years, crosshole ground penetrating radar has demonstrated significant potential for providing insights into the soil-plant continuum Here, we present time-lapse horizontal crosshole GPR data acquired at the field minirhizotron facility in Selhausen, Germany.
