# Abstract

Agricultural field experiments are essential to deliver results at relevant scales and in realistic conditions. While we tend to think of these fields are homogeneous soil conditions, this is often not the case. Past experiments, field genesis and history often leave their mark on the soil. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) can help reveal patterns in experimental fields and, hence, delineate more homogeneous areas where field experiments can take place. In this work, we present the procedures used to collect ECa maps of these agricultural fields. We also show the ECa maps of several experiment fields as well as their interpretation. We will also detail the methodology used and the challenges met during the process. You can already explore the maps at https://maps-706041.gitlab.io
