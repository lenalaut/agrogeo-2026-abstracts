  title: 'Geospatial Intelligence for Precision Agriculture: Integrating Multi-Sensor Drone Data for Soil-Water-Crop Dynamics'
  description: Precision agriculture is increasingly reliant on geospatial technologies to optimize resource use and improve crop productivity. This keynote explores the integration of multi-sensor data, ranging from multispectral and hyperspectral imaging to LiDAR, thermal, and ground-penetrating radar, acquired via autonomous drones.
