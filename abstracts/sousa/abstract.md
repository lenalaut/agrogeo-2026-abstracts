# Abstract

Precision agriculture is increasingly reliant on geospatial technologies to optimize resource use and improve crop productivity. This keynote explores the integration of multi-sensor data, ranging from multispectral and hyperspectral imaging to LiDAR, thermal, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR), acquired via autonomous drones. We present methodologies for modeling spatio-temporal dynamics of soil-water-plant interactions, leveraging advanced geospatial analytics and machine learning. Case studies from ongoing research projects demonstrate how these technologies support decision-making in irrigation management, soil health monitoring, and yield prediction. The talk will also highlight the role of satellite data fusion and real-time sensor networks in building scalable, adaptive systems for sustainable agriculture.
