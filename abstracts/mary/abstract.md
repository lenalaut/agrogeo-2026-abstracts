# Abstract

At a field site near Madrid, we set up an experiment running for several growing seasons to investigate how soil moisture influences barley phenology and yield. The experimental plot was divided into four subplots, each receiving a different treatment: fertilization, irrigation, both, or neither.

Initial geophysical surveys revealed unexpected long-term soil legacy effects. On a loamy soil with almost no topography and a very shallow water table, after a substantial rainfall, we anticipated the soil would be uniformly saturated; however, EM survey indicated differences in electrical conductivity both near the surface and at a depth of 1 m, depending on the treatment. Similar patterns were observed using ERT tomography along the survey line (at another time of the year).

These findings, together with observations from another site with saline irrigation, highlight the importance of exercising caution when performing initial measurements in an agronomic system, as prior management and environmental history can strongly influence soil properties.
