# Abstract

Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) is widely used as an integrative indicator of soil properties influencing crop performance, while vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI) provide spatially and temporally detailed information on crop development. Both variables are increasingly used to delineate management zones, yet crop growth is a complex process in which the soil interacts with other environmental drivers. Identifying when and where soil effects emerge during the growing season remains challenging for adapting agricultural management (e.g. irrigation and fertilization) accordingly.
We hypothesize that spatiotemporal correlation analysis between ECa and NDVI can reveal shifts in soil conditions that constrain or promote crop growth. Positive correlations indicate conditions favorable for growth, whereas negative correlations suggest limiting factors. We apply this approach in irrigated cropping systems in southern Spain – including olives, maize, cotton, tomato and sugar beet – under both non-saline and salinization-prone conditions. Results show that the sign and magnitude of correlations vary over time, reflecting changes in soil water and salinity dynamics and their influence on crop development. These patterns provide actionable insights for site-specific management and improve the interpretation of agronomic field experiment outcomes.
This framework offers a practical tool for diagnosing soil-driven variability and guiding precision interventions in water-limited environments. The integration of proximal soil sensing and UAV imagery enhances the capacity to monitor and manage soil–crop interactions at field scale.
