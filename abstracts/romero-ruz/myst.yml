  title: What is the economic cost of soil compaction? Initial estimation via geophysical mapping and continental agroecosystem modelling
  description: Soil compaction is a threat with negative impacts on soil ecosystem services, such as food production, groundwater recharge and climate regulation. This study discusses an approach to estimate them by combining (1) continental-based agroecosystem simulations of compaction induced economic losses and (2) case study-based quantification of soil compaction spatial extent with geophysical methods.
