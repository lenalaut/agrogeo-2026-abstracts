  title: Novel methodologies for multi-sensor data fusion for high-resolution soil mapping
  description: High-resolution digital soil mapping is essential for precision agriculture, yet most operational mapping still relies on single-sensor surveys, often depending on what is available. This study provides methodological insights into cost-effective multi-sensor data fusion and outlines a practical workflow towards PA and soil digital twins.
