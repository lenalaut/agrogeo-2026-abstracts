# Abstract

Agricultural subsurface drainage systems (DS) are installed to remove excess water from poorly drained soils to improve crop growth and field trafficability. However, many DS were installed decades ago and their locations are often undocumented or imprecise. Accurate DS maps are essential for assessing the amount of nutrient leaching contributing to eutrophication of surface water bodies and to initiate proper mitigation strategies. Conventional detection methods are labor-intensive, destructive, and provide only localized identification. Proximal soil sensors such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray spectrometry (GRS), along with remote sensing based on visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, offer potential non-destructive alternatives. However, their performance is highly variable across soil types and moisture conditions, necessitating systematic evaluation under controlled conditions.
This study assesses the suitability of GPR, GRS, VIS, and TIR for detecting DS under defined soil texture and moisture conditions. A controlled experiment of six lysimeters with three soil texture types was established. For each soil texture type, one lysimeter included an artificially installed drainpipe and a corresponding lysimeter representing soil without a drainpipe. Volumetric soil moisture content was monitored with TDR probes at multiple depths while overhead irrigation simulated controlled precipitation–drainage cycles. Sensor surveys will be conducted at predetermined moisture states to evaluate detection performance. Additionally, forward modelling using gprMax will support interpretation of GPR signal responses across soil conditions. This study is expected to determine the optimal conditions, detection limits, and constraints of each sensing approach supporting the development of robust guidelines for subsurface drainage mapping.
